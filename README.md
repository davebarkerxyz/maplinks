# 🗺️ Map Links

Generate some Google Maps transit directions links from a given origin to a set of preset destinations.

## Why 🧐

Because when house hunting I needed a quick way to get transit directions from potential new houses to some fixed places (work, my wife's mum's house, my parents' house) to see if the location was viable.

## Configuration

Copy *destinations.sample.js* to *destinations.js* and fill in your destinations.

As it's using the [Google Maps URL API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/urls/get-started) it doesn't require an API key and is entirely client-side.
